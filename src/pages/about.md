Hey I'm Chris, Developer Advocate & Web Accessibility Specialist.

My passion for the Web and the technologies that accompany it are ever growing. I love to look at code and great design and figure out how it all works. The common goal I try to achieve is to create, develop, and improve Web sites/applications making them not only visually appealing, but also great in function and usability. Teaching, learning, and problem solving are also characteristics I enjoy taking on, especially when it involves the Web. I am motivated to produce excellent results and expand my knowledge for my passion along the way.

I also have a strong passion for usability, accessibility, and performance within the Web space and care about clean, well crafted code.
